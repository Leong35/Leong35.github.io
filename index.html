   <h2>Why u should bulk</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>You can't train like a beast and eat like a bird</li>
   </ul>

   <h3 id="g-thang">Top 3 bodybuilders</h3>
   <ol>
     <li>Jay Cutler</li>
     <li>Phil Heath</li>
     <li>Shawn Rhoden aka the flexatron</li>
   </ol>

   <p>You have to prepare yourself to spend a lot of time cooking and eating food. The first 4 years I trained, I had poor results even though I trained hard. I didn't know anything about nutrition, but when I started reading about it and applying it to myself, things started happening. Then I became lazy and didn't put to much attention to my routine (I was in and out of the gym for almost 10 years). Until one day somebody ask me to be his bodyguard but my body wasn't in the best shape and I started doing just pushups and chins and over the next year I gained 45 pounds of muscle.</p>

   <h2>Songs</h2>
   <p class="em-song">Same song and dance <br>
   I like the way <em>you</em> move <br>
 <strong>same song and dance </strong> <br> </p>
 <p class="em-song">All over the globe,</p <br> </p>
